This project is a Virtual Zoo Management System written in C#. It replicates animal administration in a zoo, with an emphasis on object-oriented programming techniques such as inheritance, polymorphism, method overloading, and interfaces

Objectives 
Implementing Inheritance: Create a basic class for animals and extend it with individual animal types to construct hierarchies. 
Implementing Polymorphism: Use polymorphism to permit varied behaviors among animals, such as their ways of speaking or movement, by overriding procedures. 
Using Methods and Method Overloading: Use methods to replicate animal behaviors and interactions, and apply method overloading to handle various scenarios or inputs. 
Using Interfaces: Create and implement interfaces to standardize specific capabilities or functions among animals, such as feeding or mobility.

Project Tasks 
Task 1: Class Hierarchy and Inheritance. 
Create a basic class called Animal with shared attributes (such as Name and Age) and methods (such as Eat and Sleep). 
Extend the Animal class to construct particular animal classes (e.g Lion, Buffalo, Leopard,Elephant and Rhino), which override basic class methods to give specific behaviors.

Task 2: Polymorphism and Method Overriding. 
To demonstrate distinct behaviors, override methods in derived classes. For example, the Speak technique may produce various sounds for different animals. 
Interact with collections of the base class type (Animal) that include a variety of derived class instances to demonstrate polymorphism behavior.

Task 3: Methods and Overloading 

Implement a variety of methods within animal classes to replicate behaviors (for example, Move, Speak).
Overload methods to offer several implementations based on arguments. For example, the Eat method may accept several sorts of food.

Task 4: Implement Interfaces 
Create interfaces like IFeedable with a method Feed and IMovable with a method Move. 
Implement these interfaces in the appropriate animal classes, ensuring that the behaviors are consistent with the interface description.
